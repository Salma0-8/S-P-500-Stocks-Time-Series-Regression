Loading Up the Data – The Start of the Journey 🚀
First things first, I pulled in the three datasets and checked if everything loaded properly. No errors, so we’re good to go. Here’s what we got:

1️⃣ sp500_companies.csv → Has details on S&P 500 companies like sector, market cap, and revenue growth.
2️⃣ sp500_index.csv → Tracks the overall S&P 500 index performance over time.
3️⃣ sp500_stocks.csv → Individual stock prices with open, high, low, close, and volume data.

Quick head() check – data looks clean. No missing values so far. ✅
